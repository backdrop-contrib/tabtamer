Tab Tamer
=========

Tab Tamer lets you hide, disable and re-order all Backdrop menu tabs.

Installation
------------

- Enable the module as usual and find the configuration at:
`/admin/config/system/tabtamer`
`/admin/config/system/tabtamer/tabs`
`/admin/config/system/tabtamer/settings`
- After making changes, you must 'Clear all caches' under Performance
in order to reflect your changes.
- By default the administrative tabs are not shown. You can enable this
feature under the Settings tab. As the Tab Tamer list is cached,
you need to 'Clear all caches' when disabling or enabling this feature
in order to reflect your choice.
